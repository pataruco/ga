            We suggest starting with a{' '}
            <span className="italic">single page</span> of a website - eg. the
            homepage.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have time and the inclination, do feel free to build out
            multiple pages and functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following industry best practices of clean and readable code is
            advised but not essential. The goal is not to write perfect,
            professional code, it's to build something that you want to build so
            you have something tangible to show for your new found skills.

          <p>There is no grade or mark, or pass or fail.</p>
          <p>
            Use the project as an opportunity to create something that{' '}
            <span className="bold">YOU</span> want to create. Experiment with

          <h2>Time commitment</h2>
          <p>
            From week 5 onwards there will be no official homework. Use the out
            of class time to work on your project. We suggest spending
            approximately 5 hours per week on your project but commit whatever
            time you can.

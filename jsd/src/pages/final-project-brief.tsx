          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            For the final project, you'll be designing and building a web app of
            your choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project will test your knowledge of JavaScript and ask you to
            apply everything you've learned in this course.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result will be a web app that you can add to your portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could create anything from: a blog users can comment on; an app
            that allows users to search for social media posts; or even an
            application that logs users geolocations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Work with your instructor to create project goals that are realistic
            given the scope and timing of the class.

          <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
          <p>
            Use JavaScript to correctly structure the code for a web
            application:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Structure your application to be a SPA (single page application)
            </li>
            <li>Make HTTP requests to your own Firebase URL</li>
            <li>Make at least one HTTP request to a third-party server</li>
            <li>CRUD functionality should be present</li>
            <li>Use vanilla JS to perform DOM manipulation</li>
            <li>Listen for events and add interactivity based on user input</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Hosting</h3>
          <p>App must be hosted on either GitHub Pages</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Necessary Deliverables</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A <span className="bold">production ready web application</span>,
              SPA, hosted live on the web.
            </li>
            <li>
              A{' '}
              <span className="bold">new git repository hosted on Github</span>,
              where codebase is maintained
            </li>
            <li>
              A 5-10 minute <span className="bold">presentation</span> including
              3 technical hurdles, 2 new things you learned, Q&A.

        <section>
          <h2>Suggested Ways to Get Started</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Think of a problem in the world, or even in your personal life,
              and apply what you've learned to build an application that can
              help solve the issue.
            </li>
            <li>
              Research different APIs (i.e. twitter) and see what kind of
              information you can use from them.
            </li>

              deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given

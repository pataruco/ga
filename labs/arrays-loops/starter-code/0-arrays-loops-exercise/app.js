 * Question 1
 * Create a variable called q1. As its value, create an array of image source
 * filenames. Use "image1.png", "image2.png", and "image3.png" as the array
 * values.

 * Create a variable called q3 and store the length of the q1 array (number
 * of elements in the array) in your new variable.

 * Create a variable called numbers containing an array of numbers using 1, 2, 3,

 * Create a variable called q5. Set its value to the average of the values in

/**
 * Question 6
 * Create a variable called q6 containing an array of numbers using

 * in the original array. This should result in the original array you created

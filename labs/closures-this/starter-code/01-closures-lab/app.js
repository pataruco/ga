/*
  1) Create a function that accepts a number as a parameter, and does two
      things when it's called
      - adds the number to an array
      - logs the array value to the console
  2) Modify your function so it returns an inner function, using a closure to
      reference the array created by the outer function.
      You should then be able to pass additional values to the returned
      function and have them added to the original array.
      HINT: The inner function will need to accept a parameter for the new
      array element.
  3) Test your code by creating two different arrays using the main function,
      assigning each a different variable name.
      You should then be able to call each of these new functions to add values
      to each of the arrays independently, without affecting each other's values.

/**
 * Try to manipulate the page
 *
 * Easiest
 * 1) Get the title for each dog/cat services, and put them into the console using console.log
 * 2) Change the title of the page to "We're the CAT People"
 * 3) Change the main image to be something cat related.
 *
 * Harder
 * 1) Replace the call to action button background color with "red"
 * 2) Find another image and replace the header (try unsplash.com, get familiar with searching for images)
 * 3) the "Book your next Rover sitter" button, change the text of the button to say "Thanks"
 *
 * Hardest (only if you get the others first)
 * 1) Make the responsive menu work!
 * 2) Implement a modal window - "Sign up now" CTA when someone clicks the 'Sign Up' button

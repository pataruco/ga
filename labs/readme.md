# Labs

## What is it

It is a folder with starter and solution codes for all the courses labs ðŸ§ª

Each labs has a main folder with the following structure

```text
lab-name
|
|- readme.md
|- starter-code
    |-index.html
    |-styles
    |-scripts
    |-readme.md
|- solution-code
    |-index.html
    |-styles
    |-scripts
    |-readme.md
starter-code.zip
solution-code.zip
```

The idea behind it, is to have in the same repo a reference for the lab with a link to download a zip

## Development

Once you finished creating/amending a lab run the following to update the zip file for the solution/starter code

```sh
make create-zip application=<NAME OF THE LAB FOLDER>
```

You can copy in the clipboard the solution or starter zip file URL that is stored in GitHub

```sh
make get-starter-download-path=<NAME OF THE LAB FOLDER>
```

To check all commands available run

```sh
make help
```

// adapt the code from our previous exercise to use the preventDefult method from a javascript event.

// STEP 1
// create a variable for each button at the top of the page. There should be 3 in total.
// call them redBtn, blueBtn and yellowBtn

// STEP 2
// create a variable for each of the blocks in the middle of the page. Again, there should be 3 of them.
// call them redBlock, blueBlock and yellowBlock

// STEP 3
// Write a statement to add an event listener to the redBtn element. In response to the click event, it should add the class name 'hidden' to the redBlock element.

// 3.1 - test the function in the browser

// STEP 4
// Write a statement to add an event listener to the blueBtn element. In response to the click event, it should add the class name 'hidden' to the blueBlock element.

// 4.1 - test the function in the browser

// STEP 5
// Write a statement to add an event listener to the yellowBtn element. In response to the click event, it should add the class name 'hidden' to the yellowBlock element.

// 5.1 - test the function in the browser

// BONUS 1
// Add an event listener for the "Show all blocks" button that removes the hidden class from all the colored block elements.

// BONUS 2
// Modify the functions so clicking them once hides the corresponding block and clicking them again shows it again. (toggle a class)

Create objects for three different monkeys (called monkey1, monkey2, monkey3), each with the following properties:

* name
* species
* foodsEaten (initial value should be an empty array)

And the following methods:
* eatSomething(foodAsAString), which should add the specified food to the foodsEaten array
* introduce: produces a string introducing itself, including its name, species, and what it's eaten.

Create 3 monkeys total. Make sure all 3 monkeys have all properties set and methods defined.

If you are pair programming, choose which partner will initially take the pair programming role of driver and who will be the observer. 
Switch roles after creating the first object, then again after creating the second.
Also be sure each partner takes a turn in each role during the exercise steps below.

Exercise your monkeys by retrieving their properties and using their methods.
Practice using both syntaxes for retrieving properties (dot notation and brackets).

BONUS: Rewrite your code to create a single constructor function, and build each
monkey object using the constructor. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Using_a_constructor_function

## Bot unresponsive?

1. Try directly messaging your bot.

   Remember that that `hear` verb always responds to a specified word or phrase, but the `respond` very only responds when the bot is addressed directly. To trigger a `respond` command:

   - Command line: type `@` followed by the name of your bot (such as `@redbot`), a space, and then the message or command you want to send.
   - Slack: Double-click your bot's name from the workspace directory, then in the direct message window that opens, send the message or command.

2. Check that your `.js` file is in the `scripts` subfolder

   Your `.js` file must be in the `scripts` subfolder of the folder containing your hubot code. If your `.js` file is in the main folder, Slack won't know where to look for it.

3. Check that you don't also have another `.js` or `.coffee` folder in your `scripts` folder

   Your `scripts` folder should contain only the file that contains the code you want to use. Other script files might be loaded after yours, overwriting your code.

4. Wake up your bot

   A Heroku app instance is known as a **dyno**. A free dyno

   - runs for a maximum of 18 hours out of every 24
   - goes to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity

   If a sleeping web dyno receives web traffic, it will become active again after a short delay.

   If your dyno doesn't wake when you interact with your bot on Slack, go to the command line and issue the following command:

   ```sh
   heroku ps:restart
   ```

   Your bot should wake up after a few seconds.

5. If your bot is still unresponsive after completing the previous steps, it's likely that one of the script files associated with it contains a bug.

   - Push the most recent version of your code that worked to Heroku, then check if your bot becomes responsive.

   - If the previous solution didn't work, contact any classmates who share the bot with you and ask them to push the most recent version of their working code to Heroku as well.

   - Once the bot becomes responsive, you'll need to locate and fix whatever bugs are present in the JavaScript files that caused the bot to become unresponsive. Take this opportunity to collaborate with classmates and hone your debugging skills!

## CoffeeScript code that you want to understand?

CoffeeScript is often used in conjunction with Hubot; you won't need to know how to write CoffeeScript for the purposes of this class, but be aware that it will come up in Hubot examples and documentation. If you encounter a CoffeeScript file (e.g., the "example.coffee" file included with Hubot) and want to better understand what it's doing, you can use CoffeeScript to translate, or compile, the CoffeeScript
file into JavaScript code.

Below are instructions for compiling using either Visual Studio code or the command line:

### Compiling CoffeeScript to JavaScript Using Visual Studio Code

1. On the Visual Studio Marketplace website, open the page for the [CoffeeScript Preview extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drewbarrett.vscode-coffeescript-preview), then click the **Install** button to install it in Visual Studio Code.
1. In Visual Studio Code, click the **Reload** button if necessary to reload current files with the new extension active.
1. Open the CoffeeScript file you want to compile.
1. Press `command` + `shift` + `P`, type **Coffee**, then click `CoffeeScript Preview` in the menu below the search box. A new pane opens in Visual Studio Code showing the JavaScript version of the open CoffeeScript file.

### Compiling CoffeeScript to JavaScript Using the Command Line

1. In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the CoffeeScript file.
2. Use the `coffee` command with the `-c` switch (for "compile") and the `-o` switch (to specify "output"), as follows:

```js
coffee -c -o output-file.js source-file.coffee
```

where `output-file.js` is the name of the new file where the compiled JavaScript code should be stored, and `source-file.coffee` is the name of a file containing CoffeeScript code that you want to compile.

For instance, the following command compiles the CoffeeScript file `script.coffee` and saves the resulting JavaScript in a new file named `script.js`:

```js
coffee -c -o script.js script.coffee
```

Then you can open the resulting JavaScript file in a code editor and examine the code.

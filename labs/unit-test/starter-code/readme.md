# Unit tests

## Description

Using TDD patterns create a programme that

- When receive a number divisible by three output the word "fizz"
- When receive a number divisible by five output the word "buzz"
- When receive a number divisible by five and three output the word "fizzbuzz"

You have two files in the `src` folder:

- `index.js` where the programme implementation should be
- `index.test.js` where the unit tests should be

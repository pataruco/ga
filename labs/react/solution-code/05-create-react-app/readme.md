# Create React app

Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

## Creating an App

> Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 14 on your local development machine

```sh
yarn create react-app my-app
```

## Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed.

## The Student Experience

- Open and friendly learning environment
- Supportive, collaborative
- Friendly yet challenging
- Learn by doing - and making mistakes!
- Be curious - ask lots of questions
- Remember: no question is a stupid question

---

## Our Promise

- We‚Äôll focus on practical skills
- We‚Äôll teach you how to continue learning

---

## Learn by Doing

- Throughout the course we'll be creating lots of small projects to learn the various languages and techniques.

- The goal is to work towards creating a final project of your choosing and presenting it to the class on the final session

---

## Process First, Syntax Second

- This course is very practical but aims to teach you a process so you can replicate the material in your own projects.

- You don't need to remember everything we cover in detail. You just need to remember the gist of it so you look things up online and in the notes.

## Tell the difference...

Please, tell us the difference between:

### Frontend vs Backend

## Frontend vs. Backend

The development process can be broken into two areas:

<div class="row">
   <div>
      <h3>Front-End</h3>
      <ul>
         <li> How things look to the user</li>
         <li> Involves: images, content, structure</li>
         <li> HTML, CSS, and <strong>JavaScript</strong></li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   <div>
      <h3>Back-End</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>How things work</li>
         <li>Involves: ‚Äúbusiness logic‚Äù and ‚Äúdata‚Äù</li>
         <li>Ruby, PHP, C++, Java, <strong>JavaScript</strong> etc.</li>
      </ul>
   </div>
</div>

---

## Tell the difference...

Please, tell us the difference between:

### Website vs Webpage vs Web server

---

## How the Web Works?

<div class="row">
  <div>
    <picture>
      <img
        src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13839/Web%20Application%20with%20HTML%20and%20Steps.png"
        alt="Request and response cycle"
      />
    </picture>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>Browser send a HTTP request to the server</li>
      <li>
        Requests for dynamic resources are forwarded to server-side code
        (application)
      </li>
      <li>
        Application interprets the request, reads required information from the
        database
      </li>
      <li>Combines the retrieved data with HTML templates</li>
      <li>Sends back a response containing the generated HTML</li>
      <li>Browser read response and re render</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

## Pseudo code

- A great way to break down a problem into small chunks is to use pseudo code.
- Pseudo code is usually typed in comments so it has no effect on the program being written.
- It is typically written in a mixture of natural language and high-level programming constructs.
- It can make your code very understandable and even simplify debugging.

---

## Comments in JavasScript

To comment out a line hit <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>

```js
// Comment on a single line can be created by two forward slashes

// Comments are greyed out by the editor

/* 
I am a line

Multi line comments are created by using a different syntax 

I am a line
  
*/
```

---

## Pseudo code lab

### Task:

Imagine we have 3 different coloured buttons (red üî¥, blue üîµ and yellow üü°). If a user taps a button, the light changes to that colour. If the selected colour is tapped again, the light turns off.

Write the pseudo code for a programme that controls a light that can changed based on user input.

---

## Learning objectives - Review

- Differentiate between the Internet and the World Wide Web.
- Summarise the client-server model & explain how DNS lookup works.
- Write pseudocode and explain how it relates to programmatic thinking.

---

## Next session: JavaScript on the command line

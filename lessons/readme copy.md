# @shared/lessons

## What is it

Yarn/Lerna workspace for all lessons.

It is bundle it as a NPM package.

It is written in Markdown and formatted with Remark [syntax][remark-syntax].

Can be used as stand alone slides deck or been added to any [@website][@websites] in this repo.

## How to contribute

The slides are divided into 5 units:

- [FEWD](./src/fewd): Front-End Web Development course
- [FEWD ES](./src/fewd-es): Front-End Web Development course in Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ with React
- [JSD](./src/jsd): JavaScript Development cource
- [SEI ES](./src/sei-es): Software Engineer Immersive in Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

Choose a folder and then create a mardown file and name it using a kebab case convention, e.g: `css-grids.md`.

Use [Remark syntax][remark-syntax] to write the slides.

Once you add a new slide deck you can consume it as a NPM package from any [@website][@websites] in this repo, just `import`ing from the `index.ts` file in the course folder and then `export` it again.

Then from the root of the monorepo type on your terminal

```sh
yarn workspace @shared/lessons build
yarn
yarn lerna bootstrap
```

Once it is built you can added to a [@website][@websites] just adding it in the their `package.json`

```json
{
  // ...
  "@shared/lessons": "^0.0.0"
  // ...
}
```

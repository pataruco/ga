## Machine Learning

Let's talk about this data source:

.image-one-fourth[![](https://pataruco.s3.amazonaws.com/ga/ai/ai-data-source.png)]

---

## Machine Learning

Training a model is like fitting a curve to a set of data points.

1. Gather training data
2. Split data into features and labels
3. Select an appropriate model for the data
4. Generalise the data with the model
5. Predict new labels using the model

---

## Machine Learning

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sklearn.linear_model
import os

# Gather training data
datapath = os.path.join("datasets", "lifesat", "")
oecd_bli = pd.read_csv(datapath + "oecd_bli_2015.csv", thousands=',')
gdp_per_capita = pd.read_csv(datapath + "gdp_per_capita.csv",
                           thousands=',', delimiter='\t', encoding='latin1', na_values="n/a")

# Split data into features and labels
country_stats = prepare_country_stats(oecd_bli, gdp_per_capita)

X = np.c_[country_stats["GDP per capita"]]
y = np.c_[country_stats["Life satisfaction"]]

# Select an appropriate model for the data
model = sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()

# Generalise the data with the model
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict new labels using the model
# Make a prediction for Czech Republic
X_new = [[17256.918]]  # Czech Republic' GDP per capita
print(model.predict(X_new))  # Outputs [[ 5.700634022550953 ]]
```

## Machine Learning

Now let's do the same process but with a different model

1. Gather training data
2. Split data into features and labels
3. Select an appropriate model for the data ([K Nearest Neighbour Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm))
4. Generalise the data with the model
5. Predict new labels using the model

---

## Machine Learning

Now let's do the same process but with a different model. ([K Nearest Neighbour Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm))

```python
# Prepare the data
country_stats = prepare_country_stats(oecd_bli, gdp_per_capita)

X = np.c_[country_stats["GDP per capita"]]
y = np.c_[country_stats["Life satisfaction"]]

# Select model
model = sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=3)

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y)

# Make a prediction for Czech Republic
X_new = [[17256.918]]  # Czech Republic' GDP per capita
print(model.predict(X_new))  # Outputs [[ 5.5 ]]

## Machine Learning

Let's calculate the error of our models

.row[
.col[
Root Mean Square Error

![](https://pataruco.s3.amazonaws.com/ga/ai/root-mean-square-error.png)
]
.col[

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

czech_actual_life_satisfaction =
full_country_stats.loc["Czech Republic"]["Life satisfaction"]

czech_mse = mean_squared_error(
[czech_actual_life_satisfaction],
[czech_predicted_life_satisfaction]
)
czech_rmse = np.sqrt(czech_mse)

print(czech_rmse) # Outputs 1.0

```

]
]

---

## Machine Learning

Now, let's contrast the error of our models

|                        | Linear Regression | K Nearest Neighbour |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Root Mean Square Error | 0.80              | 1.0                 |

---

## Machine Learning

Now let's run the same process but with more features, in this case is the `Self reported health` feature.

So remember, the more features you have the more accurate your model will be.

---

## Machine Learning

Gather training data

---

## Machine Learning

Select an appropriate model for the data (3D Linear regression)

```python
X = three_country_stats[[
  "GDP per capita",
  "Self-reported health"
]].values
y = np.c_[three_country_stats["Life satisfaction"]]

# Select a linear model
model = sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y)

# Make a prediction for Czech Republic
X_new = [[17256.918, 60.0]]  # Czech Republic' GDP and health
print(model.predict(X_new))  # Outputs [[ 5.700634022550953 ]]
```

---

## Machine Learning

Generalise the data with the model

---

## Machine Learning

|                        | Linear Regression | K Nearest Neighbour | 3D Linear Regression |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Root Mean Square Error | 0.80              | 1.0                 | 0.77                 |

---

## Machine Learning

Now as you imagine, the more features you have the more accurate your model will be.

So we can iterate on:

1. Gather training data
2. Split data into features and labels
3. Select an appropriate model for the data
4. Generalise the data with the model
5. Predict new labels using the model

---

## Machine Learning

You get the idea...

---

## Machine Learning

Is hard!

- Data needs organising and cleaning
- Irregularities need to be replaced or removed
- Changing data format might suit your model better e.g. from continuous to discrete
- Continuous values might need scaling to bring out relationships
- You need to pick the right model for the job
- You need to pick the right hyperparameters e.g. number of nearest neighbours
- You need to pick the right performance measurement for the data and model

---

## Machine Learning

So it easy with data source like this, but what about images?

# Responsive Web Development

---

## Responsive design overview

- Fluid containers
- Media queries
- Flexible images

---

## Relative units

Further to sizing our containers in percentages, we can size other UI components (`font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, etc.) in relative units which cascade and build a system of proportions.

---

## Relative units

Common units of measurement for these components are:

- `em`
- `rem`
- `vw` and `vh`

---

## `em` vs `rem`

### `em`

- Sized based on the width of the letter "M"
- Size is relative to the parent

```css
body {
  font-size: 16px;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2em; /*font size is 32px */
}
```

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/pataruco/pen/dxGRjM)

---

## `em` vs `rem`

### `rem`

- Stands for **root** `em`.
- Based on the font-size of html (root) element

---

## Media queries

### Media Types

The two main media types are `print` and `screen`
This means we can write CSS for screen devices (laptops, tablets, mobiles) and different CSS for printing a web page out.

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 800px) {
  /*styles only apply when viewport is up to 800px */
}
```

[Codepen](https://codepen.io/pataruco/pen/bXErem)

---

## Media queries

There are lots of things we can query about the media, these are the most common.

```css
width | min-width | max-width
height | min-height | max-height
orientation
aspect-ratio | min-aspect-ratio | max-aspect-ratio resolution | min-resolution | max-resolution
```

Separate multiple clauses with `and` and negate with `not`

---

## Mobile display

To make our Media queries work we need to add this special metatag to the headin our HTML.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

---

## Using media queries

```css
.row {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.column {
  flex-basis: 100%;
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-shrink: 1;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  .row {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}
```

---

## Media queries

### Mobile first

- Start with a single column
- Add Media queries using `min-width`
- Performance benefits
- Slightly less code

---

## Media queries

### Desktop first

- Start with the full-width version
- Add media queries using `max-width`
- Can be more intuitive
- Can cause trouble scaling complex layout to narrow screen

---

## Media queries

### Breakpoints

When building a responsive site we often have some common breakpoints where we want major changes to occur. These are normally described as "mobile styles", "tablet styles" or "desktop styles".
Or small, medium or large screens.

---

## Media queries

### Breakpoints

We want to use generic breakpoints that approximate most devices at these screen sizes so we don't design layouts for specific devices.
I tend to use `500px` to approximate mobile and `800px` to approximate tablets and `1200px` to approximate desktops

---

## Media queries

### Tweakpoints

Having generic breakpoints is good but you will often need to tweak different styles to make the content or your layout look it's best.
We call these tweak points and they can take any pixel value to wrangle your layout into its best shape.

---

## Media queries

You can either put all of your media queries in one place in your stylesheet (at the bottom to ensure no specificity issues).
Or you can have multiple `@media` declarations throughout your stylesheet, setting up responsive styles directly beneath your initial CSS.

---

## Flexible images

Images have fixed dimensions that can break our fluid layouts.

We can make them flexible by setting `max-width`

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
  height: auto;
}
```

---

## Responsive images

```html
<img
  srcset="elva-fairy-320w.jpg, elva-fairy-480w.jpg 1.5x, elva-fairy-640w.jpg 2x"
  src="elva-fairy-640w.jpg"
  alt="Elva dressed as a fairy"
/>
```

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/pataruco/pen/KOVXNM)

---

## Responsive images

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg" />
  <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="elva-800w.jpg" />
  <img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva" />
</picture>
```

---

## Tools

Responsive Design testing can be tricky.
Here are some tools to help:

- [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) / [Firefox Dev Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools)
- [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/)

# Git & GitHub

---

## Version control

Have you ever lost or overwritten some work that took you ages?

---

## Version control

**Version control** is a system that enables you to take regular _snapshots_ of your work in progress called _commits_. This enables:

- Recording the history of a project
- Constant backups of your work
- A more organised development workflow
- A safer way to collaborate with others
- Tools for publishing your work online

---

## Version control

- Keeping your code organised helps you be more efficient.
- Keeping your work backed up helps you stay sane.
- Going back over the history of a project helps you learn.

---

## Git

Git is a version control system (VCS) that saves the state of your project's files and folders; basically, it takes a **'snapshot'** of what all your files look like at a given moment and stores a reference to that **'snapshot'**.

---

## GitHub

GitHub is a platform that makes it easy to manage git repositories. It provides a graphical interface to help you review and manage your code repos.

The files are hosted in the cloud so you can share the finished product with other people.

---

## Why are Git & GitHub valuable?

- Stores a history of the code, which allows developers to go back in time if something breaks
- Allows multiple developers to work on the same project
- GitHub tracks changes so you can see who worked on what (and who broke what)
- GitHub allows for feedback to be given on the code, which can increase code quality

---

## The lingo

- **Repository/Repo**: a central location in which data - typically about a project - is stored and managed
- **Clone**: download data/code from the cloud to your local machine (laptop, computer, etc.)
- **Commit**: save a version of your project to git
- **Branch**: create an additional track for the code that is separate from the 'master' branch. This allows you to work on a feature/issue without affecting the main code until your feature is finished.

---

## Commits

Think of each commit as if you copied your whole project folder and saved it somewhere safe.

This folder is labeled with a unique ID and recorded in a chronological timeline.

If you want to view what a file looked like at any point in history you can open up the folder with a certain commit ID and take a look at the files inside.

---

## Commits

Instead of making a complete copy of your project for every snapshot, Version control systems can just save the differences between files.

This keeps the history small in file size and quick to work with.

---

## Version control process

A typical git workflow goes like this:

- Create a project folder
- Initialize it as a git project
- Write some code
- Check the status of what files/folders have changed
- Mark one or more files to be added into the next snapshot

---

## Version control process

- Take a snapshot and write a message describing what you did and why
- Write some more code
- Create the next snapshot
- Rinse and repeat often
- Push your changes to an online repository

---

## Version control process

Commit often even as you experiment.

Push regularly once everything is in good shape.

---

## Commit messages

Think of each commit message like an email. You have a brief subject and (an optional) longer description to describe what you did and why

---

## Git for final projects

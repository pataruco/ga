## Machine Learning

Let's talk about this data source:

## Machine Learning

Training a model is like fitting a curve to a set of data points.

1. Gather training data
2. Split data into features and labels
3. Select an appropriate model for the data
4. Generalise the data with the model
5. Predict new labels using the model

## Machine Learning

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sklearn.linear_model
import os

# Gather training data
datapath = os.path.join("datasets", "lifesat", "")
oecd_bli = pd.read_csv(datapath + "oecd_bli_2015.csv", thousands=',')
gdp_per_capita = pd.read_csv(datapath + "gdp_per_capita.csv",
                           thousands=',', delimiter='\t', encoding='latin1', na_values="n/a")

# Split data into features and labels
country_stats = prepare_country_stats(oecd_bli, gdp_per_capita)

X = np.c_[country_stats["GDP per capita"]]
y = np.c_[country_stats["Life satisfaction"]]

# Select an appropriate model for the data
model = sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()

# Generalise the data with the model
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict new labels using the model
# Make a prediction for Czech Republic
X_new = [[17256.918]]  # Czech Republic' GDP per capita
print(model.predict(X_new))  # Outputs [[ 5.700634022550953 ]]

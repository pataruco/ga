## Frontend vs. Backend

The development process can be broken into two areas:

### Front-End

- How things look to the user
- Involves: images, content, structure
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

---

### Back-End

- How things work
- Involves: ‚Äúbusiness logic‚Äù and ‚Äúdata‚Äù
- Ruby, PHP, C++, Java, etc.

## Intro to HTML

**HTML** _(Hypertext Markup Language)_ is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit.

`My cat is very grumpy`

```html
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
```

## Nesting elements

### What is the difference?

```html
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
```

#### between

```html
<p>My cat is <strong>very grumpy.</p></strong>
```

---

## Nesting elements

### Good:

```html
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
```

### ~~Bad~~:

```html
<p>My cat is <strong>very grumpy.</p></strong>
```

---

## Block versus inline elements

There are two important categories of elements in HTML which you should know about. They are **block-level** elements and **inline** elements.

---

## Block

- They will appear on a new line from whatever content went before it, and any content that goes after it will also appear on a new line.
- Tend to be structural elements on the page that represent, for example, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, footers, etc.
- A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.

```html
<p>Paragraph</p>
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li>list item</li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

---

## Inline

- Are contained within block-level elements and surround only small parts of the document‚Äôs content, not entire paragraphs and groupings of content.
- Will not cause a new line to appear in the document; they would normally appear inside a paragraph of text.
- For example an `<a>` element (hyperlink) or emphasis elements such as `<em>` or `<strong>`.

```html
<p>
  Here is a link to <a href="www.ga.co">General Assembly</a>. Here is an
  <em>emphasis</em>. and here is a <span>common wrapper</span>
</p>
```

---

## Empty elements

Are self closing elements

```html
<img
  src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?beach"
  alt="A random beach picture"
/>
<hr />
<input type="color" id="color" />
```

---

## HTML text fundamentals

### Headings and Paragraphs

```html
<p>I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.</p>
<h1>I am the title of the story.</h1>
```

---

## HTML text fundamentals

### Implementing structural hierarchy

```html
<h1>Star Wars</h1>
<p>By George Lucas</p>

<h2>Episode IV: A New Hope</h2>
<p>It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships ...</p>

<h2>Episode V: The Empire Strike Back</h2>
<p>It is a dark time for the Rebellion...</p>
<h3>EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH</h3>
<p>
  A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots from its
  underside.
</p>
```

---

## HTML text fundamentals

### Why do we need semantics?

```html
<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>
<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;">
  Is this a top level heading?
</span>
```

---

## HTML text fundamentals

### Lists

#### Unordered

```html
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>eggs</li>
  <li>bread</li>
  <li>hummus</li>
</ul>
```

---

## HTML text fundamentals

### Lists

#### Ordered

```html
<ol>
  <li>Drive to the end of the road</li>
  <li>Turn right</li>
  <li>Go straight across the first two roundabouts</li>
  <li>Turn left at the third roundabout</li>
  <li>The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road</li>
</ol>
```

## Absolute vs relative paths

We can differentiate between an **absolute** URL and a **relative** URL by looking only at the path part of the URL.

```javascript
'./i-am-relative-path/filename.txt';
// From my current position get to a directory and then get the file

'../i-am-also-a-relative-path/filename.txt';
// From my current position go up to my parent directory and
// then to another directory and the get the file
```

```javascript
'https://www.ga.com'; // I am an absolute path
```

---

## Images

Images are placed using the `<img>` tag.

```html
<img src="img/image-name.jpg" alt="alternative text" />
```

- The `img` tag requires a `src` attribute, which tells the browser where to find the image.
- The `src` points to a resource a bit like the `href` of an `<a>` tag.

---

## Images

### Paths

- Inside webroot, a relative path could be used:

```html
<img src="images/logo.png" />
```

- Relative path

```html
<img src="../images/logo.png" />
```

- Absolute Path

```html
<img src="https://api.peteroftheday.com/random" />
```

---

## Images

`alt` attribute provides a text description of the image

```html
<img
  src="https://api.peteroftheday.com/random"
  alt="A random picture of Peter Martin"
/>
```

---

## Images

### File Formats

- `png`
- `gif`
- `jpeg || jpg`
- `svg`

---

## Images

### `png`

- 24¬≠ bit `png` have alpha transparency
- 8¬≠ bit `png` have transparency but not semi¬≠-transparency
- Large file¬≠ size due to storing transparency info.

### `gif`

- Can be animated
- Have basic transparency, like an 8¬≠ bit PNG
- Used in HTML emails as PNG not widely supported

---

## Images

### `jpeg` || `jpg`

- No transparency
- Most commonly used for photos
- Can be compressed to reduce file¬≠size

### `svg`

- Vector based
- Most commonly used for logos and illustrations
- Drawn with points and curves
- Infinitely scalable

# Intro to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:

- **Properties** which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed.
- **Selectors** which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to.

---

# Intro to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

## How it looks?

```html
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>This is my first CSS example</p>
```

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  background-color: yellow;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

```css
p {
  color: red;
}

## How does CSS actually work?

### About the DOM Document Object Model (**DOM**) represents the

Document Object Model (**DOM**) represents the document in the computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.

A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute and piece of
text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. The
nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are
parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.

---

## How does CSS actually work?

```html
<p>
  Let's use:
  <span>Cascading</span>
  <span>Style</span>
  <span>Sheets</span>
</p>
```

```txt
P
‚îú‚îÄ "Let's use:"

## CSS values and units

### Absolute vs relative

## CSS ~~Colours~~ Colors

There are many ways to specify color in CSS. The same color values
can be used everywhere in CSS, whether you are specifying text color,
background color, or whatever else.

The standard color system available in modern computers is 24 bit, which allows the display of about `16.7 million`
distinct colors via a combination of different **red**, **green** and
**blue** channels with 256 different values per channel

## 256 x 256 x 256 = 16,777,216

---

## CSS Colors

### Keywords

```html
<p>This paragraph has a red background</p>
```

```css
p {
  background-color: red;
}
```

[Full list of color names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#Color_keywords)

---

## CSS Colors

### Hexadecimal values

Each hex value consists of a hash/pound symbol (`#`) followed by six hexadecimal numbers, each of which can take a value between 0 and f (which represents 15) ‚Äî so
**0123456789abcdef**. Each pair of values represents one of the channels ‚Äî **red**, **green** and **blue** ‚Äî and allows us to specify any of the 256
available values for each (16 x 16 = 256.)

```css
p:nth-child(1) {
  background-color: #ff0000; /* equivalent to the red keyword */
}
p:nth-child(2) {
  background-color: #0000ff; /* equivalent to the blue keyword */
}
p:nth-child(3) {
  background-color: #e0b0ff; /* has no exact keyword equivalent */
}
```

---

## CSS Colors

### RGB

An RGB value is a function `rgb()` which is given three parameters that represent the `red`, `green` and `blue` channel values of the colors, in much the same way as hex values.

The difference with RGB is that each channel is represented not by two hex
digits, but by a decimal number between **0** and **255**.

```css
p:nth-child(1) {
  background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0); /* equivalent to the red keyword */
}
p:nth-child(2) {
  background-color: rgb(0, 0, 255); /* equivalent to the blue keyword */
}
p:nth-child(3) {
  background-color: rgb(224, 176, 255); /* has no exact keyword equivalent */
}
```

---

## CSS Colors

### HSL

The `hsl()` function accepts **hue**, **saturation**, and **lightness** values, which are used to distinguish between the 16.7 million colors, but in a different way:

- **Hue**: the base shade of the color. This takes a value between 0 and
  360, presenting the angles round a color wheel.

- **Saturation**: how saturated is the color? This takes a value from 0-100%, where 0 is no color (it will appear as a shade of grey), and 100% is full color saturation
- **Lightness**: how light or bright is the color? This takes a value from 0-100%, where 0 is no light (it will appear completely black) and 100% is full light (it will appear completely white)

```css
p:nth-child(1) {
  background-color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%); /* equivalent to the red keyword */
}
p:nth-child(2) {
  background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%); /* equivalent to the blue */
}
p:nth-child(3) {
  background-color: hsl(276, 100%, 85%); /* has no exact keyword equivalent */
}
```

---

## CSS Colors

### RGBA

and HSLA RGB and HSL both have corresponding modes ‚Äî RGBA and HSLA ‚Äî that allow you to set not only what color you want to display, but also what transparency you want that color to have.

```css
p:nth-child(1) {
  background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Transparent red */
}
p:nth-child(2) {
  background-color: hsla(240, 100%, 50%, 0.5); /* Transparent blue */
}
```

---

## CSS Fonts

There are numerous things we can style to make text look more interesting and more readable.

### Font properties

There are lots of CSS properties for styling text but here are some key ones:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 50px;
  font-family: 'Avenir', 'Arial', sans-serif;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-style: italic;
  line-height: 1.3;
}
```

---

## Font properties

- `font-size` sets the size of the text.
- `font-family` sets the typeface.
- `font-weight` sets the boldness (number or keyword)
- `font-style` can set italic text
- `line-height` sets the spacing between lines

---

## CSS tricks

### Centring the content

It's very common for a website to have a centered column of content, narrower than the full width of the screen. To achieve this, we wrap a containing element around the content tags that we want to center.

---

## CSS tricks

### Centring the content

A `<div>` tag is ideal for this purpose and is very commonly used to divide up the page into chunks that can be moved around as a single entity.

```html
<div>

  <p>...</p>
  <blockquote>...</blockquote>
  <p>...</p>
</div>
```

div {

  margin-right: auto;
}
```

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Recap
- Building blocks of layout
- Nested Selectors
- Google Fonts
- New CSS selectors
- Flexbox

---

## Box model

- Every element in web design is a box.
- Broadly speaking, elements are either `inline` or `block`

### `inline`

Inline elements display next to each other, in a line and are as wide and tall as the content inside of them.
Examples are elements like `<a>` tags or `<span>` tags.

### `block`

Block elements start on a new line, fill the width of their parent element and stack on top of each other.
Examples are elements like `<div>` or `<ul>` or `<p>`.

---

## Box model

We can change the type of element by changing the CSS `display` property.

```css
div {
  display: inline;
}

img {
  display: block;
}
```

---

## Box model

Boxes have a number of properties that we use to describe them and how they lay out on the page:

- `width`
- `height`
- `padding`
- `border`
- `margin`

### Content box computed size

- **width**: `width` + `padding-left` + `padding-right` + `border-left` + `border-right`
- **height** `height` + `padding-top` + `padding-bottom` + `border-top` + `border-bottom`

Wouldn't it be nice if we could simplify things?

### **Content box** vs **border box**

---

## Box sizing

I add this snippet on every site at the top of the CSS file

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

---

## Shorthand

`margin` and `padding` can be set on 1 or more sides with a single line of code

```css
div {
  margin: 20px; /* all four sides */
  margin: 20px 40px; /* top/bottom and left/right */
  margin: 20px 40px 10px; /* top left/right and bottom */
  margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px; /* top right bottom left */
}
```

> Do you see a pattern here?

---

## Border

Border is made up of 3 properties which can combine to apply the same border on all four sides

```css
div {
  border-width: 1px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: red;
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```

### Tag boxes

---

## Nested selectors

We have seen how to select elements on the page with CSS

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

Will select all `<h1>`and make them red.

---

## Nested selectors

But what if don't want all `<h1>` to be red. What if we just want the main heading in an article to be red?

We can use the tree-like structure of HTML (where we have parent, child and sibling elements) to select elements based on their parent element.

```css
article h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

Will select any `<h1>` that are children of `<article>` tags.

We call these descendent selectors and they can contain as many elements as necessary to target elements specifically.

```css
header nav a {
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

Next time we'll learn more specific types of selectors.

[Nested selectors](https://github.com/pataruco/fewd/raw/master/labs/nested-selectors/nested-selectors-starter-code.zip)

---

## Google Fonts

Google fonts is a free service that provides access to a whole range of different font families.

1. Head to http://www.google.com/fonts
2. Search for a font
3. Click the "quick use" icon (middle icon on right hand
   side)
4. Choose the font styles you need
5. Leave the character set as Latin
6. Copy and paste the `<link>` stylesheet code snippet
7. Copy and paste the font-family into your CSS eg.

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
}
```

---

## Selectors

So far we've seen the following type of CSS selectors. They match the HTML elements in your document but are quite limiting when dealing with complex projects.

```css
/* element selector */
p {
}
/* multiple elements selector */
h1,
h2,
h3 {
}
/* descendent element selector */
header a {
}
```

---

## Simple selectors

To have more control over the sections of the page to be styled, there are a whole load of other selectors available.

### Type `html`

Selects all elements that match the given node name.

```css
header {
  background-color: pink;
}
```

### Class `.name`

Selects all elements that have the given class attribute.

```css
.column {
  display: flex;
}
```

---

## Simple selectors

### ID `#name`

Selects an element based on the value of its id attribute. _There should be only one element with a given ID in a document_

```css
#hamburguer {
  position: absolute;
}
```

### Universal `*`

Selects all elements

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

---

## Simple selectors

### Attribute `[key="value"]`

Selects elements based on the value of the given attribute.

```css
input[type='email'] {
  border: none;
}
```

---

## Combinators

### `+`

Selects adjacent siblings

```css
h2 + p {
  font-family: monospace;
}
```

### `~`

Selects siblings

```css
section ~ article {
  font-family: max-width: 1280px;
}
```

---

## Combinators

### `>`

Selects nodes that are direct children of the first element

```css
ul > li {
  border-bottom: none;
}
```

### (space)

Selects nodes that are descendants of the first element.

```css
.menu-open nav {
  display: none;
}
```

---

## Pseudo classes

Other selectors include pseudo selectors for styling state. A classic example is the `:hover` state when mousing over links or the `:focus` state when filling in a form.

```css
a {
  color: red;
}
a:hover {
  color: blue;
}
input {
  background: #fff;
}
input:focus {
  background: #eee;
}
```

[MDN Index of pseudo classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes#Index_of_standard_pseudo-classes)

---

## Pseudo elements

Is keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s)

```css
/* The first line of every <p> element. */
p::first-line {
  color: blue;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

---

## Class vs Id

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/pataruco/pen/Pdqrqw)

### When to use `class` and `id`

- Add `class` attributes to the HTML for targeting with CSS.
- Add `id` attributes to the HTML for targeting with JS.
- **Don't use** ~~`id`~~ for adding styling to elements.

---

## Specificity

When writing CSS it's common for there to be conflicting properties applied to the same element.

The styles that "win" and will be rendered in the browser are determined by 3 major criteria in this order:

1. Importance
2. Specificity
3. Source Order

### Importance `!important`

CSS declarations with `!important` beat everything.
Avoid using this because it's a very heavy-handed.

```css
h1 {
  color: white !important; /*wins*/
}

#main-title {
  color: red;
}
```

---

## Specificity

We calculate a selectors specificity by counting the number of inline styles, ids, classes and element selectors.

- `style` is more powerful than
- `id` which is more powerful than
- `class` which is more powerful than
- `element` selectors

This produces a 4 digit number called the **specifcity value**.

1 `element` and 1 `id` beats 3 `elements`

```css
header #main-title {
  color: red; /* 0101 wins */
}

header div h1 {
  color: white; /* 0003 */
}
```

---

## Specificity

| Selector                                                       | style | Id  | Classes & attributes | Elements | Total specificity |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --- | -------------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| `h1`                                                           | 0     | 0   | 0                    | 1        | **0001**          |
| `h1 + p::first-letter`                                         | 0     | 0   | 0                    | 3        | **0003**          |
| `li > a[href*="en-US"] > .inline-warning`                      | 0     | 0   | 2                    | 2        | **0022**          |
| `#identifier`                                                  | 0     | 1   | 0                    | 0        | **0100**          |
| No selector, with a rule inside an element's `style` attribute | 1     | 0   | 0                    | 0        | **1000**          |

---

## Source order

If two selectors have the same level of importance and specificity, the one that comes later will win.

```css
header .title {
  color: black;
}

header .title {
  color: red; /* Wins !!*/
}
```

---

## Floats

`float` is a property that can be used to have block elements _"float"_ next to each other.

The `float` property was never really designed for layout but rather to allow text to wrap around an image.

This was a popular design style back in the day of print and web designers wanted to mimick the effect.

There are now a number of layout options available in CSS but (unfortunatly) float still remains a popular solution even though there are some weird side effects.

To enable two `block` elements to site next to each other, to create multi-column layouts, we need to `float` them.

This is because `block` elements normally stack vertically and `inline` elements don't respond to layout properties like `width` and `height`.

---

## Floats

An element can be floated to the `left` or the `right` side of its container.

```css
header .title {
  color: black;
}

head.main-content {
  width: 500px;
  float: left;
}

.sidebar {
  width: 300px;
  float: right;
}
```

---

## Floats

When elements float, surrounding elements try to flow around them which can cause some weird knock-on effects.

To get the layout back on track, we can `clear` the floats and bring everything back to normal.

```css
.footer {
  clear: both;
}
```

We can clear to the `left`, `right`, or `both` sides. Which will clear the affect of elements floating to the left, right or both left and right.

---

## Floats layout

Back in the day `floats` were the only way to introduce columns, but because a container with floats elements loose their height we need to clear that effect inmmediatly

### [Clearfix hack](http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/)

```css
.cf:before,
.cf:after {
  content: ' ';
  display: table;
}
.cf:after {
  clear: both;
}
```

## What it is ?

Officialy it's name is

### [CSS Flexible Box Layout Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/)

> _"...In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent."_

From W3C Candidate Recommendation, 19 October 2017

distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.

When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time (row or column). This can be contrasted with the **two-dimensional model** of _CSS Grid Layout_, which controls columns and rows together.

---

## Why we should use it?

[Can I use Flexbox?](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)

- No coming changes on the distant [future](https://www.w3.org/TR/?title=flex)
- Is the default layout on native web development

---

### Before we start...

Let's talk about `direction` & `align`

.row {
  display: flex;
}
```

[Flex box sandbox](https://codepen.io/pataruco/pen/XBPmqj)

---

## Flex container

An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a **flex container**. To create a flex container, we set the value of the area's container's display property to flex.

```css
.row {
  display: flex;
}
```

As soon as we do this the direct children of that container become **flex items**.

---

## Flex container

### `flex-direction`

How flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and the direction

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex-direction: row-reverse;
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
}
```

---

## Flex container

### `flex-wrap`

Specifies whether flex items are forced into a single line or can be wrapped onto multiple lines.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
}
```

---

## Flex container

### `flex-flow`

Is is a shorthand property for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` individual properties.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  /* flex-flow: <'flex-direction'> and <'flex-wrap'> */
  flex-flow: row nowrap;
  flex-flow: column wrap;
  flex-flow: column-reverse wrap-reverse;
}
```

---

## Flex container

### `justify-content`

Defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the **main-axis** of their container.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;

  /* Positional alignment */
  justify-content: center;
  justify-content: flex-start;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  justify-content: left;
  justify-content: right;

  /* Distributed alignment */
  justify-content: space-between;
  justify-content: space-around;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  justify-content: stretch;
}
```

---

## Flex container

### `align-items`

Sets the `align-self` (flex item property) value on all direct children as a group. It controls the alignment of items on the **cross axis**

```css
.container {
  display: flex;

  /* Basic keywords */
  align-items: normal;
  align-items: stretch;

  /* Positional alignment */
  align-items: center;
  align-items: flex-start;
  align-items: flex-end;
  align-items: baseline;
}
```

---

## Flex container

### `align-content`

Handles the remaining space between and around content items along the **cross-axis** with multiple lines.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;

  /* Basic keywords */
  align-content: center;
  align-content: flex-start;
  align-content: flex-end;

  /* Baseline alignment */
  align-content: baseline;

  /* Distributed alignment */
  align-content: space-between;
  align-content: space-around;
  align-content: space-evenly;
  align-content: stretch;
}
```

---

## Flex container

### `gap`, `row-gap`, `column-gap`

Handles the space between flex items. It applies that spacing only between items not on the outer edges.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;

  gap: 10px;
  gap: 10px 20px; /* row-gap column gap */
  row-gap: 10px;
  column-gap: 20px;
}
```

---

## Flex items

To have more control over flex items we can target them directly. We do this by way of three properties

- `flex-basis`
- `flex-grow`
- `flex-shrink`
- `flex`
- `align-self`
- `order`

---

## Flex items

### `flex-basis`

Specifies the initial main size of a flex item. This property determines the size of the content-box

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  flex-basis: 33%;
}
```

---

## Flex items

### `flex-grow`

Specifies what amount of space inside the flex container the item should take up. The flex grow factor of a flex item is relative to the size of the other children in the flex-container.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

---

## Flex items

### `flex-shrink`

Flex items will shrink to fill the container according to the flex-shrink number, when the default size of flex items is larger than the flex container.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  flex-shrink: 1;
}
```

---

## Flex items

### `flex`

Is a shorthand property that sets `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  flex: 1 1 25%;
}
```

---

## Flex items

### `align-self`

Aligns flex items of the current flex line overriding the align-items value. If any of the item's cross-axis margin is set to auto, then align-self is ignored.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  align-self: center; /* Put the item around the center */
  align-self: flex-start; /* Put the flex item at the start */
  align-self: flex-end; /* Put the flex item at the end */
}
```

---

## Flex items

### `order`

Specifies the order used to lay out a flex or grid item in its flex container. Items within the same container are laid out in ascending order according to their order values. Elements with the same order value are laid out in the order in which they appear in the source code.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  order: 1;
  order: -1;
}
```

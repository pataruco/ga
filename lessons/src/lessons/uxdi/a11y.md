## What is Web accessibility (a11y)

### Common definitions

> "Accessibility is most often used to describe facilities or amenities to assist people with disabilities, as in 'wheelchair accessible'. This can extend to Braille signage, wheelchair ramps, audio signals at pedestrian crossings, walkway contours, website design, and so on."

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility)

## What is Web accessibility (a11y)

### Common definitions

> "**The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people**, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.

## What is Web accessibility (a11y)

## Why should we care?

### Human Rights üá∫üá≥

#### Equality and non-discrimination

All individuals are equal as human beings and by virtue of the inherent dignity of each human person. All human beings are entitled to their human rights without discrimination of any kind, such as race, color, sex, ethnicity, age, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, disability, property, birth or other status as explained by the human rights treaty bodies.

#### Participation and inclusion

Every person and all peoples are entitled to active, free and meaningful participation in, contribution to, and enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural development, through which human rights and fundamental freedoms can be realized.

## Why should we care?

### It is the Law ‚öñÔ∏è

- [EN 301 549](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj) in the EU
- [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://www.section508.gov/training) in the USA
- [Accessibility Regulation 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents)

> Note: [Domino's v. Robles](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-1539/102950/20190613153319483_DominosPetition.pdf). On October 7th of 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a blind man‚Äôs accessibility lawsuit against Domino‚Äôs Pizza to proceed, paving the way to enforce more companies to provide accessible digital services.

## Why should we care?

### Business üí∏

But if following the law is not enough stimulus, I am going to name another one: SEO! Search engine indexers (Yahoo !, Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) use semantic HTML to extract information about a web page.

It means that to have accessibility as a core leads to better chances that the content we are serving will be best ranked in search engines.

## Mosaic: the first browser

## Web = Open Platform

From the beginning, the web (which isn’t the same thing as the internet) was conceived as an open medium of exchange. Its architecture assumes good faith on the part of its users, for better or worse.

## The Roaring ’90s

Developers wanted to make this a standard and turned it over to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ECMA</a>, an European standards organisation.

ECMA came up with ECMAScript 1, 2, and finally version 3 in 1999 — all based off of Netscape's work. Netscape effectively open-sourced JavaScript to the world.

---

## EcmaScript vs. JavaScript

You'll see EcmaScript and JavaScript used interchangeably a lot online. ECMA is the standards body that controls the baseline actual baseline of JavaScript.

Other languages can be derived from ECMA standards, but JavaScript is far and away the most popular, hence the confusion.

---

## JScript and Internet Explorer

Microsoft, which had developed Windows into a monopoly desktop operating system, saw the popularity of Netscape and tried to reverse engineer how JavaScript worked without given it backward compatibility to Netscape's real version of JavaScript.

This led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">JScript</a>, a non-compatible JavaScript-like scripting language for Internet Explorer. &#x1F926;

## Internet Explorer Takeover

With its monopoly power, Microsoft pushed a free version of IE without JavaScript onto every computer. This significantly set the internet back.

A broad-scale tech industry war broke out as Microsoft destroyed Netscape and assumed the position as the only browser vendor in the early 2000s. Microsoft faced anti-monopoly legislation for doing this but the court case took a **LONG** time.

---

## The Dark Ages

### Early–mid-2000s

This was a dark period for the internet. There wasn't a scripting language standard, and major work around JavaScript stopped at ECMA because of disagreements between major vendors.

The end result was that programs couldn't really be programs on the internet because they were missing functional pieces browsers didn't have (Microsoft actively wanted the web to stay small so it wouldn't impact its desktop monopoly).

---

## Open Source Rises

The open-source community began to try to overcome the Internet Explorer monopoly.

Netscape's core code was open-sourced under the original codename _"Mozilla"_ and then eventually Mozilla Firefox in 2005.

---

## jQuery to the Rescue!

The real tipping point was the most ingenious solution to the Internet Explorer issues: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Resig" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">John Resig</a> reverse-engineered how JavaScript operated and then made a new JS-like, open-source language that worked on every browser, including Internet Explorer.

It was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">jQuery</a> and took off around 2006–2007.

---

## JavaScript Standardises

2008 saw Google Chrome released, which followed in the footsteps of Firefox — both championing a singular version of JavaScript.

2009 saw the reemergence of ECMA group, rebranding ECMAScript to Version 5.

This is when the internet exploded with possibilities (we're living in the result).

---

## Finally, Real JS

Now, Mozilla and Chrome pushed a singular version of JavaScript for the first time. It would take Microsoft many years to admit defeat and join the standard, but by around 2013–2014, a common-form of JavaScript would work in every browser (ES5) with the release of the last version of IE (Version 11).

---

## ES6+ (_EcmaScript version 6_)

2015 saw the release of ES6, which was a dramatic expansion of the baseline JavaScript toolkit, and it was taken up rapidly by all browser vendors.

There is now a yearly release of JavaScript that adds new features (called ESYYYY — so, like ES2021).

## Browser share

## What makes JavaScript special?

- It has overcome a ridiculous history.
- Almost all programming languages require code to be compiled before viewing.
- JavaScript is unique because its compiler is your browser, so you can see your work immediately.
- JavaScript runtime machine has been abstracted and now can be used on the server side (back-end).

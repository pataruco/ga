  <h1>11 Conditional statements</h1>

## Agenda

- Define conditional statements in JavaScript to create logic-driven programs.
- Use switch statements to encapsulate complex logical chains.
- Choose the correct logical operators to enhance conditional statements.

---

## Comparison Operators

### Why Use Conditional Statements?

Conditional logic allows you to create **vastly more complex programs**. Think of the decision-making process of giant flowcharts...

## Comparison Operators

First, we'll need comparison operators â€” a set of operators that give you the ability to compare values and return a Boolean result (true or false).

| Comparison Operator | Meaning                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `>`                 | Greater than                           |
| `>=`                | Greater than or equal to               |
| `<`                 | Less than                              |
| `<=`                | Less than or equal to                  |
| `===`               | Strict equality (value and data types) |
| `!==`               | Strict inequality                      |

## Comparison Operators

### Double vs. Triple Equals

#### `==` vs `===`

#### `!=` vs `!==`

Double equals doesn't check for type, so it won't care if the data types are the same. This can lead to some unpredictable behavior!

Triple equals â€” the strict equality operator â€” will compare both the value and data type, creating much more predictable results.

**Just use triple equals!**

---

## Conditional Statements

Conditionals are function-like statements that take Booleans as inputs:

```javascript
if (valueOne === valueTwo) {
  console.log('Valid');
}
```

Note the **code block** defined in curly braces (`{ }`). This code block executes if the Boolean provided is `true`.

---

## `else` Statements

You will often want to have an `else` statement immediately after the `if` statement. This will trigger when the `if` comparison turns out to be `false`.

```javascript
if (valueOne === valueTwo) {
  console.log('Valid');
} else {
  console.log('Invalid');
}
```

---

## Multiple Conditions

```javascript
if (test1 === test2) {
  console.log('test1 and test2 are equal');
} else if (test1 > test2) {
  console.log('test1 is greater than test2');
} else {
  console.log('none of the conditions were met');
}
```

---

## Careful! Equals Aren't All Equal...

When you use `=`, that is an **assignment operator**.

If you try to use `=` instead of `===` in a comparison statement, you will get strange results â€” it will always evaluate as `true`!

```javascript
// This won't work the way you think it will!
let temperature = 0;
if ((temperature = 100)) {
  console.log('Always going to happen!');
}
```

---

## Logic Operators

Logic operators allow us to combine multiple conditions together. For very complex conditionals, you can put several conditions in parentheses to evaluate them as a single expression.

- **`&&` (AND)** : Evaluates to `true` only if all combined values are `true`.
- **`||` (OR)** : Evaluates to `true` if any of the combined values are `true`.
- **`!` (NOT)** : Reverses the Boolean result of whatever follows it.

---

## Multiple Conditions, One Statement

You can check to see if two conditions are met in one statement with a logic operator:

```javascript
let clickDetected = true;
let clickTwoDetected = false;

if (clickDetected === true && clickTwoDetected === false) {
  // do something
}
```

---

## Using `!`

The **not** operator, `!`, is a great way to check if something exists in the JS memory system.:

```javascript
let whatever; // would be undefined, no memory assignment
if (!whatever) {
  console.log(`Turns out whatever doesn't exist!`);
}
```

If there isn't a comparison inside a conditional statement, JS will interpret the argument as a Boolean. The only values that would equate to false are `0`, `-0`, `null`, `NaN`, `undefined`, or `''`, so nearly anything that exists will pass the test.

---

## Pro Tip: Condensing Conditionals

Like we saw in the previous slide, not all conditionals need a comparison statement â€” especially if the values being tested are already Booleans!

Thus, you will rarely see a comparison with `=== true` or `!== false`.

Instead, developers will use the following pattern:

```javascript
if (clickDetected && !clickTwoDetected) {
  // do something
}
```

---

## `switch` Statements

switch is an implicit equality comparison (`===`). It's comparing the argument of `switch` with each `case`. The `switch` looks for every matching `case`, then performs instructions until it hits `break`, which exits the chain.

```javascript
let transportOption = 'car';
// Add class to <div id="dest"> depending on variable
switch (transportOption) {
  //                                                                      --
  case 'car' //  <-- Condition                                              |
    document.querySelector('#dest').classList.add('car'); // <-- Instruction|
    break; // <-- Stop ðŸ›‘                                                   |
  case 'bus': //                                                            |
    document.querySelector('#dest').classList.add('bus'); //                |--Container
    break; //                                                               |
  case 'metro': //                                                          |
    document.querySelector('#dest').classList.add('metro'); //              |
    break; //                                                               |
} //                                                                      --
```

---

## Multi-Case `switch`

`switch` can be used to funnel multiple cases to the same instruction. Just list cases together before the instruction/break combo, and you can cleanly handle similar cases:

```javascript
switch (seasonCheck) {
  case 'autumn':
  case 'fall':
    console.log("It's fall now!");
    break;

  case 'spring':
  case 'getting warmer':
    console.log('Spring time is near');
    break;
}
```

## Making Conditionals Easier

Conditionals make programs harder to debug because more operations can take place in any given program.

- Use functions to encapsulate code as necessary.
  - If the code inside a conditional takes up five lines or more, it will become hard to keep track of which layer of conditional weâ€™re in. Make it a function!
- `console.log()` is your friend.
  - Leave yourself messages to figure out what path a conditional took.
  - If a conditional gives you mysterious results, log the values and data types.
- Use `switch` statements for situations with four or more cases.
  - The setup for a `switch` only pays off in lengthier situations.

## Key Takeaways

> Conditionals Allow Decisions

- Use conditionals to allow JavaScript to make logic-based decisions.
- Conditionals are one tool in the control flow toolbox.
- Use logical operators and conditional chains for more complex reasoning.

  ## For Next Time

JavaScript Loops and Arrays

- Loops will allow you to repeat a code block until a condition is met.
- Loops are another example of control flow determining how and when code should execute.
- Arrays are collections of data that allow us to store multiple things together.

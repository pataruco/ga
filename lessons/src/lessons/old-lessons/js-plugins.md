## JavaScript plugins

A plugin is a self-contained bundle of JavaScript (and sometimes CSS and images) that adds interaction and functionality without you having to write the code yourself!

---

## JavaScript plugins

They are just JavaScript code that you could write yourself, but instead of "reinventing the wheel" we can leverage other peoples abilities and save a lot of time.

---

## JavaScript plugins

Using plugins has the following benefits:

- You don't have to be a JavaScript expert to have a visually rich project Huge time savings
- Most are very customisable
- Most are open source (free)
- Most have been well tested and improved over time Most have been well documented
- Most have working examples for you to copy+paste

## JavaScript plugins

However, with all this goodness, there are some downsides:

- Using loads of plugins adds to page weight
- Some plugins aren't very flexible/stable/well made
- Some functionality is so simple, you don't really need a plugin

## JavaScript plugins

So, how do I get all this goodness?
Well, once you know the kind of functionality you want to add or the result you want to achive we need 3 things:

1.  Find a suitable plugin and read the documentation
2.  If it sounds like it does what you need, download it, unzip the files into your project and include the plugin assets via script and linktags in your HTML
3.  Initialize the plugin (sometimes)

## JavaScript plugins

Using JavaScript plugins is really an exercise in reading instructions and following them.
If you get stuck, a quick search of Google/Stack Overflow should help you get back on track.

## Waypoints

This is a library that allows you to trigger JavaScript behaviour when the user scrolls to a certain point in the page.

It's a very lightweight library but comes in really useful for drawing attention to a particular element or section of the page just in time for the user to see it.

---

## Waypoints

A classic example is to add a class to an element which triggers a transition or animation to reveal or hide an element.

This means you can add subtle entrance/exit effects as elements move through the viewport.

## Project time

**Challenge**: think of some functionality that you could add to your project with a JavaScript plugin. It could be one we've looked at or something completely different.
Try to follow the documentation to add the plugin to your project.

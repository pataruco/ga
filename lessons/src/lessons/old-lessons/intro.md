# Instructional team intro

## [Nicholas Wilson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-lawrence-wilson/)

Hey everyone, sorry I couldn't be with you this evening actually not that sorry, I'm having a great holiday!. A bit about me: about 18 months ago, I quit my job as a civil engineer to do a full time web development immersive at general assembly. It's without doubt the best decision I have ever made!
After the course, I stayed on at general assembly as a teaching assistant for the next three month immersive before taking a frontend developer role at an awesome company called edited.com. And now I'm also your teaching assistant! I really can't wait to meet you guys on Wednesday, it's going to be a lot of fun!

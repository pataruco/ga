# CSS Reset

There are a lot of annoying default styles that are inconsistent across browsers.
Sometimes we might want to remove them all so we have a blank canvas.

# CSS Positioning

- Precise placement of elements
- Tweak position of elements
- Not for layout
- Mostly for tackling complex design

---

# CSS position property

CSS `position` can take 1 of 4 values.

`static` is the default and does not have to be set.

- `static`
- `relative`
- `absolute`
- `fixed`

---

# `position: relative`

- Move elements `relative` to themselves
- Create a parent container
- Position elements absolutely inside

---

# `position: absolute`

- Set the absolute co-ordinates of an element to be positioned
- `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`
- Use `px`, `%`, `em` and any other CSS unit

---

# `position: fixed`

- Fix an element in place, regardless of scroll
- Set co-ordinates of where to fix an element
- Position is set relative to the body

---

# `z-index`

- `z-index` controls the stacking order.
- The `z-axis` comes out of the screen towards you
- Itâ€™s a bit like Photoshop layers
- `z-index` only works for position other than static

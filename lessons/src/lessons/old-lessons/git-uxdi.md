# Version control

### Have you ever lost or overwritten some work that took you ages?

---

# Git & GitHub

---

# Git

Git is a version control system (VCS) that saves the state of your project's files and folders; basically, it takes a **'snapshot'** of what all your files look like at a given moment and stores a reference to that **'snapshot'**.

---

# The lingo

- **Repository/Repo**: a central location in which data - typically about a project - is stored and managed
- **Clone**: download data/code from the cloud to your local machine (laptop, computer, etc.)
- **Commit**: save a version of your project to git
- **Branch**: create an additional track for the code that is separate from the 'master' branch. This allows you to work on a feature/issue without affecting the main code until your feature is finished.

---

# GitHub

GitHub is a platform that makes it easy to manage git repositories. It provides a graphical interface to help you review and manage your code repos.

The files are hosted in the cloud so you can share the finished product with other people.

---

# Why are Git & GitHub valuable?

- Stores a history of the code, which allows developers to go back in time if something breaks
- Allows multiple developers to work on the same project
- GitHub tracks changes so you can see who worked on what (and who broke what)
- GitHub allows for feedback to be given on the code, which can increase code quality

# Steps

**Review files**

Review the files that have been changed since your last commit.

---

# Steps

**Commit**

When you commit your changes, you are creating a unique **snapshot** of your code. So be sure to write a meaningful commit message to help you find the correct **snapshot** if you ever need to come back to this commit.

# Steps

**Commit**

# Steps

**Publish**

Once you've committed your first changes, you can 'publish' your repo. This will push it up to Github.

_Note: Always be sure to untick the 'Keep project private' checkbox so that we can review it._

---

# Steps

**Push**

Once your repo has been published, you'll then only be able to 'push' your changes. Every time you push after a commit, it will update the remote repo with your latest code.

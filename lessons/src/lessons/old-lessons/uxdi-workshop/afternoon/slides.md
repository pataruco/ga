# Software engineering process

## Discovery & challenge:

We investigate the technical requirements for the feature we are going to build

we work with:

- User experience designer
- Product designer
- Strategy lead
- Tech lead

---

# Software engineering process

We use **Git** for our version control.

Some Git jargon:

- Repository
- Local vs remote
- Push / pull
- Branch
- Commit
- Merge
- Pull request

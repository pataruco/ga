# Lessons

## What is it

Nx library for all lessons.

It is written in Markdown and formatted with Remark [syntax][remark-syntax].

Can be used as stand alone slides deck or been added to any website in this repo.

## How to contribute

The slides are divided into 5 units:

- [bonus](./src/lessons/bonus): Bonus lessons
- [FEWD](./src/lessons/fewd): Front-End Web Development course
- [FEWD ES](./src/lessons/fewd-es): Front-End Web Development course in Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ with React
- [JSD](./src/lessons/jsd): JavaScript Development cource
- [SEI ES](./src/lessons/sei-es): Software Engineer Immersive in Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

Choose a folder and then create a mardown file and name it using a kebab case convention, e.g: `css-grids.md`.

Use [Remark syntax][remark-syntax] to write the slides.

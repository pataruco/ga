## The Student Experience

- Open and friendly learning environment
- Supportive, collaborative
- Friendly yet challenging
- Learn by doing - and making mistakes!
- Be curious - ask lots of questions
- Remember: no question is a stupid question

---

## Our Promise

- We‚Äôll focus on practical skills
- We‚Äôll teach you how to continue learning

---

## Learn by Doing

- Throughout the course we'll be creating lots of small projects to learn the various languages and techniques.

- The goal is to work towards creating a final project of your choosing and presenting it to the class on the final session

---

## Process First, Syntax Second

- This course is very practical but aims to teach you a process so you can replicate the material in your own projects.

- You don't need to remember everything we cover in detail. You just need to remember the gist of it so you look things up online and in the notes.

  </div>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>Browser send a HTTP request to the server</li>
      <li>
        Requests for dynamic resources are forwarded to server-side code
        (application)
      </li>
      <li>
        Application interprets the request, reads required information from the
        database
      </li>
      <li>Combines the retrieved data with HTML templates</li>
      <li>Sends back a response containing the generated HTML</li>
      <li>Browser read response and re render</li>

## Tell the difference...

Please, tell us the difference between:

### Frontend vs Backend

---

## Frontend vs. Backend

The development process can be broken into two areas:

### Front-End

- How things look to the user
- Involves: images, content, structure
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

---

### Back-End

- How things work
- Involves: ‚Äúbusiness logic‚Äù and ‚Äúdata‚Äù
- Ruby, PHP, C++, Java, etc.

## Tell the difference...

Please, tell us the difference between:

### Website vs Webpage vs Web server

    <ul>
      <li>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content.</li>
      <li>CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content.</li>
      <li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to manipulate dynamically content and style.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

## Intro to HTML

**HTML** _(Hypertext Markup Language)_ is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit.

`My cat is very grumpy`

```html
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
```

---

## Anatomy of an HTML element

---

## Nesting elements

### What is the difference?

```html
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
```

#### between

```html
<p>My cat is <strong>very grumpy.</p></strong>
```

---

## Nesting elements

### Good:

```html
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
```

### ~~Bad~~:

```html
<p>My cat is <strong>very grumpy.</p></strong>
```

## Block versus inline elements

There are two important categories of elements in HTML which you should know about. They are **block-level** elements and **inline** elements.

---

## Block

- They will appear on a new line from whatever content went before it, and any content that goes after it will also appear on a new line.
- Tend to be structural elements on the page that represent, for example, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, footers, etc.
- A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.

```html
<p>Paragraph</p>
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li>list item</li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

---

## Inline

- Are contained within block-level elements and surround only small parts of the document‚Äôs content, not entire paragraphs and groupings of content.
- Will not cause a new line to appear in the document; they would normally appear inside a paragraph of text.
- For example an `<a>` element (hyperlink) or emphasis elements such as `<em>` or `<strong>`.

```html
<p>
  Here is a link to <a href="www.ga.co">General Assembly</a>. Here is an
  <em>emphasis</em>. and here is a <span>common wrapper</span>
</p>
```

---

## Empty elements

Are self closing elements

```html
<img
  src="https://api.peteroftheday.com/random"
  alt="A random Picture of Peter Martin"
/>
<hr />
<input type="color" id="color" />
```

---

## HTML text fundamentals

### Headings and Paragraphs

```html
<p>I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.</p>
<h1>I am the title of the story.</h1>
```

---

## HTML text fundamentals

### Implementing structural hierarchy

```html
<h1>Star Wars</h1>
<p>By George Lucas</p>

<h2>Episode IV: A New Hope</h2>
<p>It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships ...</p>

<h2>Episode V: The Empire Strike Back</h2>
<p>It is a dark time for the Rebellion...</p>
<h3>EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH</h3>
<p>
  A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots from its
  underside.
</p>
```

---

## HTML text fundamentals

### Why do we need semantics?

```html
<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>
<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;">
  Is this a top level heading?
</span>
```

---

## HTML text fundamentals

### Lists

#### Unordered

```html
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>eggs</li>
  <li>bread</li>
  <li>hummus</li>
</ul>
```

---

## HTML text fundamentals

### Lists

#### Ordered

```html
<ol>
  <li>Drive to the end of the road</li>
  <li>Turn right</li>
  <li>Go straight across the first two roundabouts</li>
  <li>Turn left at the third roundabout</li>
  <li>The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road</li>
</ol>
```

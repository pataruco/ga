# FEWD Week #3: CSS Layouts

## Description

Relaxr was really impressed by your work last week and wants you to continue development on their landing page.

Starting in class, you will work to build out a more complex layout for their company site. They decided on creating a blog, and their back-end engineers will be focused on developing the blog's functionality.

They want your front-end skills to style their designs using HTML and CSS so Relaxr's engineers can begin integrating.

Once again, the designers have handed you a basic [design file with instructions][instructions] and the JPEG below to help you bring the blog to life. Submit the finished version for homework.

## Technical Requirements

- Use `flexbox` in your CSS to achieve a two-column layout
- Use the correct `Open Sans` Google Font typeface to style the text denoted in the [design file][instructions] and according to the JPEG provided
- Use proper filename conventions (lowercase, .html)
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use a background image for the headers
- Add a hover effect to all the links using pseudo-classes
- Integrate drop caps using pseudo-classes

### Bonus

- Link the "Blog" link in the header to the page you've built for this assignment
- Link the "About" link in the header to the landing page you built last week
- Up for a real challenge? Use `<script>` tags in your HTML to make a dialogue box pop up when a user clicks "Sign Up Now!" that reads "We're Not Ready For Sign-Ups...Yet."

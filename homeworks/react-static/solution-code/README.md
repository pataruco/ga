The starter code contains all the data you will need inside the `<App />` component's `state` object.

## Requirements

- Break the design down into separate components
- Inject the data when necessary via `props`.

## Tips

- All the CSS you need is provided - you **don't** need to do any styling.
- There is also an example of what the final HTML should look like in the `example.html` file inside the starter code. **You should use this as a reference for class names and structure.**
- The images in the gallery are background images - you don't need to add them in using image tags. If you stick to the HTML markup defined in the `example.html` file you will be able to see them.
- Don't forget to install all the packages with `yarn`
- Launch the app with `yarn start`

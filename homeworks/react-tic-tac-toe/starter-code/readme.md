# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description

Let's start out with something fun - a game

We'll be making Tic Tac Toe, a game that takes seconds to learn but minutes to master! Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges to get your feet wet in the world of React web development.

## Technical Requirements

- Render a game board in the browser
- Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
- Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw if neither wins
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use React for DOM manipulation
- Stores the history of moves made throughout the game.
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

## Bonus

These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

- Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
- Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
- Get inventive with your styling, e.g. use hover effects or animations to spiff things up
- Use `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
- Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
- Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- Check out Tutorial and Documentation resources
- Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

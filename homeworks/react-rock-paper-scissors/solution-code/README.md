# React Rock Paper Scissors

Using the starter code provided your challenge is to re-create a simple Rock Paper Scissors implementation in React.

## Requirements

- When a user makes their choice (rock, paper or scissors), you should also randomly generate a computer choice
- Write some logic to determine who has won
- Display the player's choice and the computer's choice
- Display the winner on the page
- When the reset button is clicked, clear the choices and the winner from the screen

## Bonus

- Once you have completed the basic game, add some styling.
- Add two more buttons so that you can play [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Play-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/)!

## Tips

- **DO NOT** copy and paste a vanilla JavaScript version of the game into the `app.js` file then try to refactor it in React
- Structure your HTML in the `return` method of `App` before you start adding your event handlers
- Keep It Stupid Simple
